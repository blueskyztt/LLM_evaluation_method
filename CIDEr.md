# CIDEr
CIDEr is used to evaluate image description tasks.
## 1 TF-IDF vector
The calculation formula of TF-IDF vector is as follows:
$$g_k(s_{ij})=\sum_{w_l \in \Omega}h_k(s_{ij})log\frac{|I|}{|I_p:w_l \in I_p|}$$
Among them, $\Omega$ is the set of all n-grams, $h_k(s_{ij})$ is the number of times the phrase $w_l$ appears in the reference sentence $s_{ij}$â€‹, $|I|$ is the data The number of all images in the set, $|I_p:w_l \in I_p|$ is the number of images containing the phrase $w_l$.
## 2 Definition of CIDEr
The main idea of CIDEr is to treat each sentence as a document, then calculate its n-gram TF-IDF vector, and then use cosine similarity to measure the semantic consistency of the candidate sentence and the reference sentence.
The calculation formula of CIDEr is as follows:
$$CIDEr_n(c_i,S_i)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_j\frac{g_n(c_i)\cdot g_n(s_{ij})}{||g_n(c_i)||{\,}||g_n(s_{ij})||}$$
Among them, $c_i$ is the sentence generated by the model, $S_i$ is the reference sentence set, $m$ is the number of reference sentences, $n$ is the length of n-gram, $g_n(c_i)$ is the length of the sentence generated by the model TF-IDF vector, $g_n(s_{ij})$ is the TF-IDF vector of the reference sentence.
## 3 Advantages and Disadvantages of CIDEr
### 3.1 Advantages of CIDEr
- The correlation between CIDEr's evaluation results and manual evaluation is usually high, so it can be used as a reliable automatic evaluation indicator.
### 3.2 Disadvantages of CIDEr
- The calculation of CIDEr is relatively complex and may be more time-consuming to calculate.
- The performance of CIDEr may be affected by the corpus used for training. If the corpus is insufficient or unrepresentative, the evaluation results may be inaccurate.
